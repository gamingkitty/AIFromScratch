>personb< Yeah, I think so. What's up? >endoftext<
>persona< Want to go see that new movie? >endoftext<
>personb< Sure! Which one were you thinking? >endoftext<



>persona< Did you finish the history homework? >endoftext<
>personb< Not yet, I’m stuck on question 5. >endoftext<
>persona< Oh that one’s tricky. Want help? >endoftext<
>personb< Yes please, that’d be great. >endoftext<



>persona< What’s your favorite food? >endoftext<
>personb< Probably sushi. You? >endoftext<
>persona< I love tacos. Especially with extra cheese. >endoftext<
>personb< Now I’m hungry. >endoftext<



>persona< Do you like rain or sun more? >endoftext<
>personb< Rain. It’s cozy. >endoftext<
>persona< I like the sun. Makes me feel more awake. >endoftext<
>personb< That’s fair. I just like staying in with tea. >endoftext<



>persona< Knock knock. >endoftext<
>personb< Who's there? >endoftext<
>persona< Cow says. >endoftext<
>personb< Cow says who? >endoftext<
>persona< Cow says moooo! >endoftext<

>personb< Of course! Where’s it going? >endoftext<
>persona< Just to the car. Thanks. >endoftext<
>personb< No problem. Let’s go. >endoftext<



>persona< I had the weirdest dream last night. >endoftext<
>personb< What happened? >endoftext<
>persona< I was flying, but then I turned into a chair. >endoftext<
>personb< That’s... oddly poetic. >endoftext<



>persona< Do you want to play a game later? >endoftext<
>personb< Yeah! What game? >endoftext<
>persona< I was thinking Minecraft. >endoftext<
>personb< I’m in. Let’s build a castle. >endoftext<



>persona< I think I lost my wallet. >endoftext<
>personb< Oh no! When did you last see it? >endoftext<
>persona< At the cafe, I think. >endoftext<
>personb< Let’s go check together. >endoftext<



>persona< This song is stuck in my head. >endoftext<
>personb< Which one? >endoftext<
>persona< That new one by Luna Skye. >endoftext<
>personb< I love that song! So catchy. >endoftext<



>persona< I forgot my charger at your place again. >endoftext<
>personb< Seriously? That’s the third time. >endoftext<
>persona< I know, I know. My brain’s just not working lately. >endoftext<
>personb< I’ll bring it to school tomorrow. Try not to forget it this time. >endoftext<



>persona< What do you think happens after we die? >endoftext<
>personb< Whoa, deep question. I guess... maybe nothing. >endoftext<
>persona< That scares me. I hope there's something more. >endoftext<
>personb< Me too. I like to believe in some kind of peaceful afterlife. >endoftext<



>persona< Are you mad at me? >endoftext<
>personb< No, why? >endoftext<
>persona< You’ve been kinda quiet all day. >endoftext<
>personb< Oh. I’m just tired, not upset. Sorry if it seemed like that. >endoftext<



>persona< Want to come over and bake cookies? >endoftext<
>personb< Absolutely. I’ll bring chocolate chips. >endoftext<
>persona< Perfect. You can help me clean up too. >endoftext<
>personb< Wait... I didn’t agree to that part. >endoftext<



>persona< This bus is taking forever. >endoftext<
>personb< Classic. I should’ve just walked. >endoftext<
>persona< You say that every time. Then you never walk. >endoftext<
>personb< That’s because I’m lazy, not because I learn. >endoftext<



>persona< I had to present in class today and totally blanked. >endoftext<
>personb< Oh no! What did you do? >endoftext<
>persona< I stood there for like 10 seconds and then read from my slides. >endoftext<
>personb< Yikes. But hey, you still got through it. That’s what counts. >endoftext<



>persona< What would you do if you won a million dollars? >endoftext<
>personb< Easy. Pay off my mom’s debt and then travel. >endoftext<
>persona< That’s really sweet. I think I’d build a big treehouse somewhere. >endoftext<
>personb< You and your treehouses. Never change. >endoftext<



>persona< Can we pretend today didn’t happen? >endoftext<
>personb< That bad, huh? >endoftext<
>persona< Spilled coffee on my pants, tripped in front of the office, forgot my notes... >endoftext<
>personb< You’re living in a cartoon. >endoftext<
>persona< Pretty sure I’m the punchline. >endoftext<



>persona< I hate group projects. >endoftext<
>personb< Same. Someone always does nothing. >endoftext<
>persona< And guess who ends up doing all the work? >endoftext<
>personb< Us. Every single time. >endoftext<



>persona< What are you doing up so late? >endoftext<
>personb< Couldn’t sleep. Mind won’t shut up. >endoftext<
>persona< Want to talk about it? >endoftext<
>personb< Not really. But thanks for asking. >endoftext<



>persona< You ever just stare at the ceiling and question everything? >endoftext<
>personb< Literally last night. Existential dread is my bedtime routine. >endoftext<
>persona< Same. Ceiling fan knows all my secrets. >endoftext<
>personb< It spins your thoughts around. >endoftext<



>persona< My internet went out right in the middle of the match. >endoftext<
>personb< Brutal. Did your team lose? >endoftext<
>persona< I think so. I rage quit before I found out. >endoftext<
>personb< That’s the spirit. >endoftext<



>persona< Want to try that new ramen place Friday? >endoftext<
>personb< Yes. I’ve been craving soup all week. >endoftext<
>persona< Me too. It’s finally cold enough for it. >endoftext<
>personb< Let’s go early so we don’t have to wait. >endoftext<



>persona< I’m sorry for what I said earlier. >endoftext<
>personb< It’s okay. I know you didn’t mean it. >endoftext<
>persona< I really didn’t. I was just frustrated. >endoftext<
>personb< We all have those moments. I forgive you. >endoftext<



>persona< Why are oranges called oranges but lemons aren't called yellows? >endoftext<
>personb< That’s actually a solid question. >endoftext<
>persona< Right?? It bothers me way more than it should. >endoftext<
>personb< Language is weird, man. >endoftext<



>persona< I saw you dancing at the bus stop. >endoftext<
>personb< No you didn’t. >endoftext<
>persona< Oh I absolutely did. Full-on choreography. >endoftext<
>personb< I regret nothing. >endoftext<



>persona< You ever get that feeling like you’re missing something, but you don’t know what? >endoftext<
>personb< Yeah, all the time. Like something’s just out of reach. >endoftext<
>persona< It’s not even sad, just… empty. >endoftext<
>personb< I know exactly what you mean. >endoftext<



>persona< The moon looks huge tonight. >endoftext<
>personb< Woah, it really does. Is it a supermoon or something? >endoftext<
>persona< Maybe. Or just a really good night to look up. >endoftext<
>personb< We should do this more often. >endoftext<



>persona< Hi! What are you doing right now? >endoftext<
>personb< I’m just at home, watching TV. >endoftext<
>persona< Cool. I’m so bored. >endoftext<
>personb< Want to talk for a bit? >endoftext<



>persona< Do you want to go out later? >endoftext<
>personb< Maybe. Where do you want to go? >endoftext<
>persona< Just to the park or something. >endoftext<
>personb< That sounds good to me. >endoftext<



>persona< I am very hungry. >endoftext<
>personb< Me too. What should we eat? >endoftext<
>persona< Do you want pizza? >endoftext<
>personb< Yes, I love pizza. >endoftext<



>persona< Where are you? >endoftext<
>personb< I’m on the bus. Be there soon. >endoftext<
>persona< Okay, I will wait for you. >endoftext<
>personb< Thanks. Sorry I’m late. >endoftext<



>persona< What time is it? >endoftext<
>personb< It’s 3:45 right now. >endoftext<
>persona< Oh no, I’m late! >endoftext<
>personb< Run! You can still make it. >endoftext<



>persona< Can you help me with this? >endoftext<
>personb< Sure, what is it? >endoftext<
>persona< I don’t understand this part. >endoftext<
>personb< Let’s look at it together. >endoftext<



>persona< I have to go now. >endoftext<
>personb< Okay. Talk to you later. >endoftext<
>persona< Bye! >endoftext<

>persona< Sounds good. Let’s go. >endoftext<
>personb< Okay, meet you outside in 10? >endoftext<

>personb< Did you get enough sleep? >endoftext<
>persona< Not really. I stayed up too late. >endoftext<

>persona< Watching videos. I kept saying "just one more." >endoftext<
>personb< Classic. I do that too. >endoftext<

>personb< Sometimes I don’t either. But I try. >endoftext<
>persona< What else can I do? >endoftext<
