>newconversation<
>persona< What do you think happens after we die? >endoftext<
>personb< Whoa, deep question. I guess... maybe nothing. >endoftext<

>newconversation<
>persona< This bus is taking forever. >endoftext<
>personb< Classic. I should’ve just walked. >endoftext<
>persona< You say that every time. Then you never walk. >endoftext<
>personb< That’s because I’m lazy, not because I learn. >endoftext<
>newconversation<
>persona< I had to present in class today and totally blanked. >endoftext<
>personb< Oh no! What did you do? >endoftext<
>persona< I stood there for like 10 seconds and then read from my slides. >endoftext<
>personb< Yikes. But hey, you still got through it. That’s what counts. >endoftext<
>newconversation<
>persona< What would you do if you won a million dollars? >endoftext<
>personb< Easy. Pay off my mom’s debt and then travel. >endoftext<
>persona< That’s really sweet. I think I’d build a big treehouse somewhere. >endoftext<
>personb< You and your treehouses. Never change. >endoftext<
>newconversation<
>persona< Can we pretend today didn’t happen? >endoftext<
>personb< That bad, huh? >endoftext<

>newconversation<
>persona< You ever just stare at the ceiling and question everything? >endoftext<
>personb< Literally last night. Existential dread is my bedtime routine. >endoftext<
>persona< Same. Ceiling fan knows all my secrets. >endoftext<
>personb< It spins your thoughts around. >endoftext<
>newconversation<
>persona< My internet went out right in the middle of the match. >endoftext<
>personb< Brutal. Did your team lose? >endoftext<
>persona< I think so. I rage quit before I found out. >endoftext<
>personb< That’s the spirit. >endoftext<
>newconversation<
>persona< Want to try that new ramen place Friday? >endoftext<
>personb< Yes. I’ve been craving soup all week. >endoftext<

>newconversation<
>persona< I’m sorry for what I said earlier. >endoftext<
>personb< It’s okay. I know you didn’t mean it. >endoftext<
>persona< I really didn’t. I was just frustrated. >endoftext<
>personb< We all have those moments. I forgive you. >endoftext<
>newconversation<
>persona< Why are oranges called oranges but lemons aren’t called yellows? >endoftext<
>personb< That’s actually a solid question. >endoftext<
>persona< Right?? It bothers me way more than it should. >endoftext<
>personb< Language is weird, man. >endoftext<
>newconversation<
>persona< I saw you dancing at the bus stop. >endoftext<
>personb< No you didn’t. >endoftext<
>persona< Oh I absolutely did. Full-on choreography. >endoftext<
>personb< I regret nothing. >endoftext<
>newconversation<
>persona< You ever get that feeling like you’re missing something, but you don’t know what? >endoftext<
>personb< Yeah, all the time. Like something’s just out of reach. >endoftext<
>persona< It’s not even sad, just… empty. >endoftext<
>personb< I know exactly what you mean. >endoftext<
>newconversation<
>persona< The moon looks huge tonight. >endoftext<
>personb< Woah, it really does. Is it a supermoon or something? >endoftext<

>newconversation<
>persona< Do you want to go outside? >endoftext<
